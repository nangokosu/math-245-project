## Project proposal:
Our project seeks to use a variety of Gapminder country level statistics from 2016 to determine which variables correlate strongly with the overall level of happiness in a country (as measured by the Happiness Index), and how.

```{r cars}
df=readRDS("./merged_gapminder_happiness.rds")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
